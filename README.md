# Project Report: Multiple Linear Regression Analysis  

## Overview  
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of Multiple Linear Regression techniques applied to a dataset with 10 predictor variables. The objective is to develop an optimal regression model that best explains the variation in the response variable.

## Key Sections  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Univariate and categorical analysis, heatmaps, and transformations.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Outlier detection using Cook’s Distance and DFFITS, handling influential observations.  
3. **Model Fitting** – Simple linear regression models, full model fitting, and transformations.  
4. **Model Selection** – Selection based on criteria like Adjusted R², AIC, BIC, Mallows’ Cp, and PRESS residuals.  
5. **Feature Selection** – Techniques including Forward Selection, Backward Elimination, and Stepwise Selection.  
6. **Assumption Validation** – Checking for homoscedasticity, multicollinearity, normality, and independence.  
7. **Cross-Validation** – K-Fold cross-validation for model performance evaluation.  

## Conclusion  
The report explores different model selection techniques, validates assumptions, and ensures robustness through cross-validation. It highlights the significance of feature selection in improving model performance and interpretability.
